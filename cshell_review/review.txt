## System calls used:

- `chdir()`
- `exit()`
- `fork()`
- `execvp()`
- `wait()`
##  Can the shell receive commands with arguments?

- Yes. A command `ls -a -l` is tested and it gives an expected result. 

## Can the shell use input redirection?

- Neither `>` nor `|` is implemented in the shell.

## Does the shell use the system variable $PATH?

- Yes. There is used `execvp()` system call, which searches for an executable in directories defined in `$PATH`  variable, however only if a command does not include `/`.

## How well is the program explained?

- Extensive comments, which explains the code very well.

## What have your learnt from the peers assignment?

-  I learned that `cd` is build-in command in the bash and there is no such a executable in /bin/ directory like `cd`. So in order to change a directory in the shell`chdir()` system call should be used.
- I also got deeper understanding what an input redirection is exactly, because it's explained very-well by Jákup in his report. 
##  What would you have done differently.
- There was noticed in the report that program exists, when `cd` is used. I fixed this bug simply by refactoring line 86 from `exit(EXIT_SUCCESS)` to `continue;`. After this `cd` works without any problem. 
- There is missing the explanation of `Program Environment` in the rapport. And again the system call `execvp()` uses environment defined in `$PATH` variable.  
- And of course Implement an input redirection and a pipe function.
